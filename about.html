			<p id = "yuuki">
			An Filipino original, Retail Rhapsody was founded by <mark>Yuuki Yango</mark> in 1980.</p>
			<p id = "mantra">
			The idea of Rhapsody developed from a business he founded as a teenager to 
			re-sell 78-rpm jukebox records in his mother's Mercury drug store, and it 
			evolved into a record megastore that would change the way we connect with 
			music in the predigital era. From the ‘80s through the '00s, Rhapsody was 
			he reigning music retailer, an oasis at the intersection of music, art, and 
			culture known for its volume and backed by its deeply knowledgeable, audiophile 
			staff. An iconic mecca for music discovery, Rhapsody's strong visual codes and 
			community philosophy ignited a sense of identity across generations with the 
			mantra: <span style = "color: #810801"><b>“Nothing Really Matters but Music”</b></span>. At its peak, Rhapsody grew 
			to more than 200 locations in 20 galaxies and 18 planets, and more than 1 trillion 
			annual sales. A global brand with a clear and compelling vision.</p>
			<p id = "elyezky">
			Retail Rhapsody applied a fresh and innovative attitude towards management, with a 
			‘local-first’ approach that allowed the stores to run with an independent spirit and 
			thus with a finger on the pulse of the musical and cultural zeitgeist. Upon entering a 
			Retail Rhapsody store, visitors were greeted by knowledgeable aficionados and tall stacks 
			of the latest albums near the front door. Long aisles contained thousands of titles in 
			every imaginable music genre created. The store stayed open late and became evening hangouts 
			for thousands of music fans, who would stop in and buy a few items as part of their nights out: 
			The Rhapsody on Sunrise Boulevard in  Atlanta and Broadway in Backburner's Ruby Village were 
			landmarks in their own right. The shops made devotees of the stars. <mark>Elieza Murillo</mark> and 
			<mark>Eliza Supangan</mark> were regular visitors, and Rhapsody's most famous patron was <mark>Kyan Nuqui</mark>.</p>
			<p id = "bye">
			Rhapsody continues to define the blueprint for what a music experience should be, bridging 
			innovation, tradition and experimentation. A space for unique individuals with a passion for 
			sound to connect, discover, and consume music. The original source for curation and expertise.</p>
